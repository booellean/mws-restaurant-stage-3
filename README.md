# Restaurant Review App Stage 3
## A Project by **Elle Pope** a.k.a **booellean**

### __Special thanks to the Entire Udacity Team and Google!__

I have had a *blast* in this program.  It has furthered my development as a coder, expanded my knowledge of networking, and overall made me stronger as a worker. I would like to thank Google for providing me with this diversity scholarship and the entire team at Udacity for cheering me on and helping me work through my busy schedule.

### Notes About the Code

* There is currently no backup code for browsers that don't support indexedDB. This will be implemented in the future.

* The code is dependent on a refactored database. Please use booellean's [repository][repo-link] to download the database and run with [sails.js][sails-link]

* The production files are located in `/src/prod` under the production branch while the development files are located in `/src/public/` in the master branch. Please use production files when serving the website

* The gulpfile.js is NOT my own. This was going to be used as a reference, however, my node dependencies are having issues installing and thus was not used in production of the code. The original owner of the gulfile is [seetd][github-seetd] for the project [mws-restaurant-stage-1][mws-repo].
